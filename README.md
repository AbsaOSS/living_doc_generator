A tool designed to data-mine GitHub repositories for issues containing project documentation (e.g. tagged with feature-related labels). This tool automatically generates comprehensive living documentation in Markdown format, providing detailed feature overview pages and in-depth feature descriptions.

## Motivation
Addresses the need for continuously updated documentation accessible to all team members and stakeholders. Achieves this by extracting information directly from GitHub issues and integrating this functionality to deliver real-time, markdown-formatted output. Ensures everyone has the most current project details, fostering better communication and efficiency throughout development.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have a GitHub Token with permission to fetch repository data such as Issues and Pull Requests.

### Adding the Action to Your Workflow

See the default action step definition:

```yaml
- name: Generate Living Documentation
  id: generate_living_doc
  uses: AbsaOSS/living-doc-generator@v0.1.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
  with:
    repositories: '[
      {
        "orgName": "fin-services",
        "repoName": "investment-app",
        "queryLabels": ["feature", "enhancement"]
      },
      {
        "orgName": "health-analytics",
        "repoName": "patient-data-analysis",
        "queryLabels": ["functionality"]
      },
      {
        "orgName": "open-source-initiative",
        "repoName": "community-driven-project",
        "queryLabels": ["improvement"]
      }
    ]'
  ```

## Action Outputs
The Living Documentation Generator action provides a key output that allows users to locate and access the generated documentation easily. This output can be utilized in various ways within your CI/CD pipeline to ensure the documentation is effectively distributed and accessible.

- **documentation-path**
  - **Description**: This output provides the path to the directory where the generated living documentation files are stored.
  - **Usage**: 
   ``` yaml
    - name: Generate Living Documentation
      id: generate_doc
      ... rest of the action definition ...
      
    - name: Output Documentation Path
      run: echo "Generated documentation path: ${{ steps.generate_doc.outputs.documentation-path }}"            
    ```

## Project Setup
If you need to build the action locally, follow these steps:

### Prepare the Environment
```
node --version
python3 --version
```

### Install Node.js Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compile or Prepare the JavaScript Files
```
npm run build
```

### Set Up Python Environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Scripts Locally
If you need to run the scripts locally, follow these steps:

### Create the shell script
Create the shell file in the root directory. We will use `run_script.sh`.
```shell
touch run_script.sh
```
Add the shebang line at the top of the sh script file.
```
#!/bin/sh
```

### Set the environment variables
Set the configuration environment variables in the shell script following the structure below. 
Also make sure that the GITHUB_TOKEN is configured in your environment variables.
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(printenv GITHUB_TOKEN)
export PROJECT_STATE_MINING="true"
export PROJECTS_TITLE_FILTER="[]"
export MILESTONES_AS_CHAPTERS="true"
export REPOSITORIES='[
            {
              "orgName": "OrgName",
              "repoName": "example-project",
              "queryLabels": ["feature", "bug"]
            }
          ]'
export OUTPUT_DIRECTORY="/output/directory/path
```

### Running the script locally
For running the GitHub action incorporate these commands into the shell script and save it.
```
cd src || exit 1

python3 controller.py --github-token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
            --project-state-mining "$PROJECT_STATE_MINING" \
            --projects-title-filter "$PROJECTS_TITLE_FILTER" \
            --milestones-as-chapters "$MILESTONES_AS_CHAPTERS" \
            --repositories "$REPOSITORIES" \
            --output-directory "$OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"

cd .. || exit 1
```

### Make the Script Executable
From the terminal that is in the root of this project, make the script executable:
```shell
chmod +x run_script.sh
```

### Run the Script
```shell
./run_script.sh
```

## Run unit test
TODO - check this chapter and update by latest state
### Launch unit tests
```
pytest
```

### To run specific tests or get verbose output:
```
pytest -v  # Verbose mode
pytest path/to/test_file.py  # Run specific test file
```

### To check Test Coverage:
```
pytest --cov=../scripts
```

### After running the tests
```
deactivate
```

### Commit Changes
After testing and ensuring that everything is functioning as expected, prepare your files for deployment:

```
git add action.yml dist/index.js  # Adjust paths as needed
git commit -m "Prepare GitHub Action for deployment"
git push
```

## Deployment
This project uses GitHub Actions for deployment draft creation. The deployment process is semi-automated by a workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release_draft.yml`.

- **Trigger the workflow**: The `release_draft.yml` workflow is triggered on workflow_dispatch.
- **Create a new draft release**: The workflow creates a new draft release in the repository.
- **Finalize the release draft**: Edit the draft release to add a title, description, and any other necessary details related to GitHub Action.
- **Publish the release**: Once the draft is ready, publish the release to make it available to the public.


## Features

### Data Mining from GitHub Repositories

This feature allows you to define which repositories should be included in the living documentation process. By specifying repositories, you can focus on the most relevant projects for your documentation needs.

- **Default Behavior**: By default, the action will include all repositories defined in the repositories input parameter. Each repository is defined with its organization name, repository name, and query labels.

### Data Mining from GitHub Projects

This feature allows you to define which projects should be included in the living documentation process. By specifying projects, you can focus on the most relevant projects for your documentation needs.

- **Default Behavior**: By default, the action will include all projects defined in the repositories. This information is provided by the GitHub API.
- **Non-default Example**: Use available options to customize which projects are included in the documentation.
  - `project-state-mining: false` deactivates the mining of project state data from GitHub Projects. If set to **false**, project state data will not be included in the generated documentation and project related configuration options will be ignored. 
  - `projects-title-filter: ["Community Outreach Initiatives", "Health Data Analysis"]` filters the projects by titles, including only projects with these titles.

### Living Documentation Page Generation

The goal is to provide a straightforward view of all issues in a single table, making it easy to see the overall status and details of issues across repositories.

- **Default Behavior**: By default, the action generates a single table that lists all issues from the defined repositories.
- **Non-default Example**: Use available options to customize the output, such as grouping issues by milestone.
  - `milestones-as-chapters: true` controls whether milestones are treated as chapters in the generated documentation.
